Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi."

Islam is the official religion of the UAE, and Arabic is the official language, although English is widely used. The UAE's oil reserves are the fourth-largest in the world,[7] while its natural gas reserves are the world's seventeenth-largest.[8] The late Sheikh Zayed, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first President of the UAE, oversaw the development of the Emirates and steered oil revenues into healthcare, education and infrastructure"
